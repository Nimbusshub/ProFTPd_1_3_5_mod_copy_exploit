# ProFTPd 1.3.5 mod_copy Exploit

If you prefere using Metasploit, just use the excellent
working [ProFTPd 1.3.5 - 'mod_copy' Command Execution (Metasploit)"](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37262)

There is a Python version in Exploit db
[ProFTPd 1.3.5 - 'mod_copy' Remote Command Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36803 running for a CTF machine)
but at the time of writting I did not manage to get that running.  This code follows the way the Metasploit
exploit works.  As this is just counted as a convertion from one language to another it was not accepted
by Exploit-db.
